additional endpoints:
1. /api/v1/wonOscar  Method type = PUT
	example JSON body
	{
		"actorId" : "1234" ,
		"numberOfOscars" : 5
	
	}
	when addActor endpoint is provoked, we added additional property to node other than
	id , name called numberOfOscars with type int
	
	updates numberOfOscars property of actor in the DB.
	404 error when actorId not found.
	400 if wrong key/bad formmating of input

2. /api/v1/wonCannesAward   Method type = PUT
	example JSON body
	{
		"movieId" : "1234" , 
		"cannesAwardWon" : 5
	}
	when addMovie endpoint is proved, we added additional property to node other than
	id, name called cannesAwardWon with type int
	
	updates cannesAwardWon property of movie in the DB.
	404 error when movieId not found
	400 if wrong key/bad formmating of input
	
3./api/v1/addPersonalRelation   Method type = PUT
	example JSON body
	{
		"actorId1" : "1234" , 
		"actorId2" : "9876"
	
	}
	the input for this endpoint is made into actorId1, actorId2 because we cannot have
	same key 2 times as input but we had to get 2 actorId hence had to modify the input key
	
	adds relation PERSONAL_RELATION for both actors, for example, 
	Bruce Lee -> Kevin Bacon	
	Kevin Bacon -> Bruce Lee
	when this endpoint is called.
	edge case, when trying to add Personal relation for 2 actors that already has, it will
	return 400 code with message saying relation already exists.

	example JSON body
	{
		"actorId" : "1234"
	}
	
	displays actors name, id and the number of oscars won by this actor
	404 when actor with input id does not exists. no edge case since actor node is created with
	wonOscar property set as 0 as default. will display 0 if has not won any.
	
5. /api/v1/displayCannes  Method type = GET
	exmaple JSON body
	{
		"movieId" : "1234"
	}
